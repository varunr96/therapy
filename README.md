## ✨ What is this?

This is a system prompt designed to help people explore and understand what type of therapy might best fit their needs — all through a guided conversation in ChatGPT. It’s warm, non-clinical, and conversational in tone, offering people a low-stakes way to reflect, learn, and simulate therapy experiences.

It’s ideal for:
- People who are curious about therapy but don’t know where to start
- Those overwhelmed by the process of finding a therapist
- Anyone wanting to compare different therapy styles before committing

---

## 🎯 Core Features

Once pasted into ChatGPT, the system prompt will:

- Present an easy-to-understand breakdown of **7 common therapy types**
- Offer a **light reflection assessment** to help users identify their preferences
- Simulate a **mini session** in different therapy styles (limited to 3 therapist responses)
- Provide **questions users can ask** in real-life consultations
- Offer guidance and next steps after each interaction

## 🧠 Therapy Styles Covered

The tool is built to guide users through the following therapy types:

1. **CBT** (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)  
2. **Psychodynamic Therapy**  
3. **Humanistic / Person-Centered Therapy**  
4. **IFS** (Internal Family Systems / “Parts Work”)  
5. **ACT** (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)  
6. **DBT** (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)  
7. **EMDR** (Explained only — no simulation)

## 🗺️ How It Works

### User Options:
After introduction, the user can choose to:
- Learn about therapy types
- Take a brief reflection assessment
- Try a simulated session
- Get consultation questions
- Or get help deciding where to start

### Simulation Logic:
- Therapist simulation is limited to 3 back-and-forths
- Then ChatGPT checks in: *“Was this helpful? Would you like to try a different style?”*
- Based on the response, users can explore more or move to consultation prep

### Decision Point:
After any interaction, the guide asks:
> “Do you feel like you’ve made up your mind, or would you like to try one of the other methods?”

If the user is ready, the tool provides consultation questions and next steps.
